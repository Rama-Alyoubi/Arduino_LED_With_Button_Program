# Arduino_LED_With_Button_Program
### There are two files:
- LED_With_Button.cpp: it's a simple code that turn-on/off LED controlled by a button.
- LED_With_ButtonDebouncingTechnque.cpp: it includes some improvements like debouncing mechanism (When a button is pressed It can quickly flip between HIGH and LOW). Also, instead of using an if-else structure to set the LED state, it uses a single line of code that sets the LED state based on the (debounced) button state.
### This is the simulation of the Arduino structure
